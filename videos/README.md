### Videos of our best model (CYOLO-SB+A) trying to track several pieces from the test sets

On the left you will see the score image together with the prediction of the model. (Note that the repetitions are not considered in this work)
To the right we visualize the last two seconds of audio. The prediction itself will be based on more than this excerpt (see Section 3.2).
The predicted bounding box for the note position is visualized in red and the actual ground truth position as a blue line. Additionally, we visualize the predicted bar and system.

In the folder `MSMD-Rec` you find two pieces with a synthetic (clean) sheet image and a real piano recording.

- Johann Sebastian Bach - BMV924a Prelude - Performed by Jan Hajič jr.
- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - KV331 Variation 1 - Performed by Carlos Eduardo Cancino Chacón
